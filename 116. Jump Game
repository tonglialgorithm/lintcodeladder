116. Jump Game
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example
A = [2,3,1,1,4], return true.

A = [3,2,1,0,4], return false.


class Solution:
    """
    @param A: A list of integers
    @return: A boolean
    """
    def canJump(self, A):
        # write your code here
        n = len(A)
        f = [False for i in range(n)]
        
        f[0] = True
        
        for j in range(1, n):
            for i in range(j):
                if f[i] and i + A[i] >= j:
                    f[j] = True
                    break
        
        return f[n - 1]
