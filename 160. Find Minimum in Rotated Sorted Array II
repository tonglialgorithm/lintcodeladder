160. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

Example
Given [4,4,5,6,7,0,1,2] return 0.

class Solution:
    """
    @param nums: a rotated sorted array
    @return: the minimum number in the array
    """
    def findMin(self, nums):
        # write your code here
        min = nums[0]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] < min:
                min = nums[i]
        return min
