63. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
Follow up for Search in Rotated Sorted Array:

What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

Example
Given [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] and target = 0, return true.
Given [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and target = 0, return false.

class Solution:
    """
    @param A: an integer ratated sorted array and duplicates are allowed
    @param target: An integer
    @return: a boolean 
    """
    def search(self, A, target):
        # write your code here
        for num in A:
            if num == target:
                return True
        return False
