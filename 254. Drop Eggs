254. Drop Eggs
There is a building of n floors. If an egg drops from the k th floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break.

You're given two eggs, Find k while minimize the number of drops for the worst case. Return the number of drops in the worst case.

Example
Given n = 10, return 4.
Given n = 100, return 14.
