619. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence III

It is follow up problem 614

Given a k-ary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.
The path could be start and end at any node in the tree

Example
An example of test data: k-ary tree 5<6<7<>,5<>,8<>>,4<3<>,5<>,3<>>>, denote the following structure:


     5
   /   \
  6     4
 /|\   /|\
7 5 8 3 5 3

Return 5, // 3-4-5-6-7
